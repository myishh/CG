------week 1------
For the 1st week, I have done such work:
1) Set up html interface, which consists of three parts: SVG, house building, house transforming. For the house building and house transforming parts, I decide to use from and fieldset to store and submit the data of the house.
2) Learn the algorithms to create a 3D house by drawing three 2D elevations. To implement the drawing, need to input the house data, such as width, height and depth of the house. Then, based on such data, a simple house could be drawn out and show up on the canvas.
3) Implement the 3D transformations to the house by inputting the house coordinates. To achieve the transformation, we need the translation coordinates(x & y), rotation, scaling rate and shearing coordinates(x & y). By using those data, I set up the interface to transfrom font elevations, side elevation and the top elevation.

------week 2------
For the 2nd week, I have finished such work:
1) Implement the 3D transformations to the house by inputting the house coordinates. To achieve the transformation, we need the translation coordinates(x & y), rotation, scaling rate and shearing coordinates(x & y). By using those data, I set up the interface to transfrom font elevations, side elevation and the top elevation.
2)Implement the transformation by dragging the mouse on canvas. For this part, front elevation, side elevation and top elevation, all those 3 elevation could be transformed by translation, rotation, scaling and shearing.

------week 3------
For the 3rd week, I have done such work:
1) Rebuild the user interface with HTML and CSS.
2) Multiple projections: Orthographic, Axonometric, and Oblique.
3) Implement the 3D translation and 3D rotation in each view by sliding the range slider in the navigation bar.
4) Texture mapping of the object.

------week 4------
For the 4th week, I have done such work:
1) Implement 3D scaling and 3D shearing for each of those projections: Orthographic, Axonometric, and Oblique.
2) Add point light transformation to the object.

------week 5------
For the 5th week, I have done such work
1) Camera transformation to the object.
2) Directional light demonstration

------week 6 (final)------
For the 6th week(last submission), I have done such work:
1) Vanishing points (1, 2, 3) to the object.
