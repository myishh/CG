For the 2nd week, I have finished such work:
1) Implement the 3D transformations to the house by inputting the house coordinates. To achieve the transformation, we need the translation coordinates(x & y), rotation, scaling rate and shearing coordinates(x & y). By using those data, I set up the interface to transfrom font elevations, side elevation and the top elevation.

2)Implement the transformation by dragging the mouse on canvas. For this part, front elevation, side elevation and top elevation, all those 3 elevation could be transformed by translation, rotation, scaling and shearing.
