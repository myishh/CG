For the 1st week, I have done such work:
1) Set up html interface, which consists of three parts: SVG, house building, house transforming. For the house building and house transforming parts, I decide to use from and fieldset to store and submit the data of the house.
2) Learn the algorithms to create a 3D house by drawing three 2D elevations. To implement the drawing, need to input the house data, such as width, height and depth of the house. Then, based on such data, a simple house could be drawn out and show up on the canvas.
3) Implement the 3D transformations to the house by inputting the house coordinates. To achieve the transformation, we need the translation coordinates(x & y), rotation, scaling rate and shearing coordinates(x & y). By using those data, I set up the interface to transfrom font elevations, side elevation and the top elevation.
