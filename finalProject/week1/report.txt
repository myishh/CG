During the 1st week, I have done such work.
1) Learn how to create a 3D house by drawing three 2D elevations. To do so, just need to input the house data, such as width, height and depth of the house.
2) Implement the 3D transformations to the house. For this part, I figure out 2 approaches, one way is input detailed value of each elevation. Another way is dragging the house after deciding the elevation and transformation type.
