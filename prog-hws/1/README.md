## COMP.5460 Computer Graphics I (Spring 2018)
### Programming Assignment 1: 2D Drawing

I have finished the 1st programming assignment. Among the all files, "hw1.html" is the main file. I have implemented the interface that requires entering numerical parameters. More over, I implemented an interactive interface in the HTML file "hw1_interactive_version.html".
