Among the all files, "hw2.html" is the main file. In this programming assignment, I have implemented the interface that requires entering numerical parameters.

For the problem 1, after choosing the primitive, ratio and color, click the "Draw Fractal" button to show the result. 
For the problem 2, first of all, input the radius value and drive's score, then click the "Draw Wheel" button to get the final wheel picture.
